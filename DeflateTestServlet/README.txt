This is an example servlet that generates RFC1950 and RFC1951 compressed HTTP response bodies for testing the "Deflate" Burp Plugin. A deployable war file is included in the deploy directory. Once deployed, the source code should contain enough information to begin using this test servlet. Additional information about the Java compression classes used can be found at http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/zip/package-summary.html

Additional information about "Deflate" Burp Plugin can be found in its own README file or at http://www.gdssecurity.com/l/b
